        <h1 class="pageIntro"> <b>About Me</b></h1>
        <h4 class="pageIntro">Zirui Li, <br>A new graduate student in Software Engineering from University of Calgary with extensive experience of SDE and DS. A new graduate student in Software Engineering from University of Calgary with extensive experience of Python, Linux, Java, React, GitHub CI/CD and SQL/NoSQL. Within oil and gas area, I had 1 year full time internship in data analysis and full stack development roles.

            From internship, I have experience of hosting a data visualization website that can handle real-time data transfer. I optimized data analysis, processed over raw data entries. Additionally, I logged user actions and scheduled processes. I built CI/CD and automated installation tools. I analyzed system performance and generated technical reports to present in team meetings.
            
            I believe I can make better UI and UX based on my experience, and I am actively seeking a full-time role that fits my qualifications. Please feel free to contact me.</h4>
